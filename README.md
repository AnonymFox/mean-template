# MEAN Template
This project can be used as template for MEAN Stack projects.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:AnonymFox/mean-template.git`
2. Install node dependencies: `cd mean-template && ./install-all.sh`

## Structure
The root folder represents the server part of the application. 
The frontend/angular2 part is in the `public` folder.
API routes are in `routes`.

## Starting and Testing
To start the server run `npm start` in the root directory. To display the frontend part, visit [localhost:3000](localhost:3000).

To debug/test the [Angular2](https://angular.io/) application, you might want to run npm start in the public directory which uses [lite-server](https://github.com/johnpapa/lite-server) for seamless developing. With this option your browser should start automatically.
